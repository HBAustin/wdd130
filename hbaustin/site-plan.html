    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
        Who is the site designed for?
    </p>
    <p>The site is designed for those who are looking for a someone who can design a simple website or to help work on a website that already exists. Its main purpose will be to show what I can do and what will be expected of me if you decide to contact me to work on a website. 

      It will allow me to quickly introduce myself and to show what I have learned for those who are looking to employ someone. This site will hopefully allow me to answer any questions that might be had.
     
      It will show my qualifications, where I studied, etc. It should be able to alleviate any concerns that might be had, will allow me to tell you about myself and will be used to show exactly what I can do, it will be a sort of ‘business card’ so that you can easily decide whether or not you are interested in what I have to offer.

    <h3>What is this site</h3>
    <p>
        What does this site do?
    </p>
    <p>This site will allow you to go around and see what I have to offer in terms of design choices and will show what I am capable of doing. 
      It will allow any interested users how to easily contact me if they so choose. The site will be set up to show the different types of effects 
      I can apply and to show my skills with layout and familiarity with HTML and CSS files. The most important pieces of information on this site
       will be mainly the different animations and CSS values I will apply, as well as multiple ways to contact me. I will need my own logo. 
       Images of myself and what I can do and what I already have done, so that people know how to easily contact me and so they know what to expect 
       if they decide to hire me.

    <h3>Why this site</h3>
    <p>
        Why use my site?
    </p>
    <p>This site will be designed to be as simple as possible, while also attempting to be as compelling and user friendly as possible. It is, 
      of course, impossible for everyone to be interested in my site, whether it’s due to design decisions or if you feel you are looking for 
      something else. And that’s okay. If you decide not to use the site, I ask that you share the site with someone else that you think may be 
      interested. If you do like the site and decide to hire me, more people are likely to be interested in my services. This is the most 
      effective way for me to get more customers. A bad customer experience will push people away, so I will do everything in my power to keep 
      any and all users happy.
