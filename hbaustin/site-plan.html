      Content

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
        Who is the site designed for?
    </p>
    People will come to my site while looking for someone to design or work on a website that already exists. 
    It will allow them to see what I can do and what they can expect if they decide to contact me to work on 
    a website. It will allow me to introduce myself and allow me to show what I have learned to future employers 
    or allow me to do independent work for others. It will allow me to answer any questions I think they might have,
     like my qualifications, where I studied, etc. It will hopefully allow me to alleviate any concerns the site visitor has
     . It will allow me to tell the visitor about myself so people can decide whether or not they are interested in my work.

    <h3>What is this site</h3>
    <p>
        What does this site do?
    </p>
    <p>will allow users to go around and see what I can offer in terms of my design choices and what I am capable of doing.
        It will also allow interested viewers to be able to easily contact me if they want to. They can go around and look 
        at the different effects I have applied to my site. The most important piece of information needed will be contact 
        information so people can easily contact me. I will also need my own logo, images of myself and what else I have 
        worked on, my skills, where Iâ€™ve studied, etc. It is important for people to know what skills I have learned and 
        what type of work I have done to make sure they know what they would be getting into if they decide to hire me.

    <h3>Why this site</h3>
    <p>
        Why use my site?
    </p>
    <p>The site will need to made as compelling as possible to keep users interested. There will be people who may not be 
      interested in my site, maybe I am not what they are looking for or they do not like my style, I will ask if they know 
      of anyone who may be interested. If others like my site and hire me to work for them, they are also more likely to share 
      what I have done with others and will allow more people to visit my site. This will be an effective way to get more people
       to come to my site. A bad customer experience will push people away, so I will do everything in my power to keep the 
       customer/future employers happy.
