    <p>Hello Everyone. I live in KZN, South Africa. I'm the one on the right.
    I am extremely excited to be learning about CSS and HTML with all of you. I really enjoy problem solving and puzzles, i enjoy the challenge they give me. At first, I felt that learning to code would just be another good challenge for me, but instead it turned into something that i really enjoyed doing, despite the challenges I had when first starting out. Last year i completed PathwayConnect and I'm very excited to be doing BYU Idaho this year. I am very excited to get to know all of you during this semester</p>
